    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cleaning all the mollusks and crustaceans. Remember to discard any open or broken mussels and clams. Start with the mussels: remove the barnacles with a paring knife, followed by the byssus.</li>
        <li>Lastly, scrape away impurities with a steel scrub and rinse thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Leave the clams to soak in water with the salt for a couple of hours for, the time it takes to purge sand from them; drain and rinse.</li>
        <li>Remember to tap each clam against the cutting board or sink to check they are whole and not filled with sand.</li>
        <li>Empty the inside of the calamari and remove the skin.</li>
        <li>Cut into 0.4 inch strips, then into large pieces, each roughly 0.8 inches in size.</li>
        <li>Lastly, clean the shrimp tails: remove the legs and the shell, along with the black string on the back: simply make a small incision on the surface and remove with a knife blade or toothpick.</li>
        <li>Now that everything is ready, you can move over to the stove. Start by cooking the mussels: heat them in a large pan on a high flame.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on and leave them to open; shake the pan occasionally.(It takes around 2-3 minutes for them to open)</li>
        <li>Filter the liquid through a colander into a container.</li>
        <li>Wait a few moments before shelling them, to avoid burning yourself. Set aside 2-3 whole mussels for each plate, you'll need them for the final decorative touch.</li>
        <li>Now cook the clams. Put the pan back on the stove and add the clams. Cover with the lid and leave them to open, shaking the pan occasionally.</li>
        <li>The bivalves will open in 1-2 minutes; as soon as this happens, filter and add the liquid to the same container used for the mussel liquid.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool for a few moments before shelling and once more set aside 2-3 whole pieces per plate.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable broth, clean the celery, carrot and fresh spring onion. Finely chop the vegetables with a knife, peel the garlic cloves and leave them whole.</li>
        <li>Lastly, clean and then finely chop the peperoncino and the parsley. Leave to one side and return to the stove. Heat a saucepan on the stove, add a generous drizzle of oil, followed by the finely chopped garlic and parsley.</li>
        <li>Leave to flavor for ten minutes or so on a low flame, stirring occasionally. Once the vegetables have softened, remove the garlic, turn up the flame to the maximum setting and add the calamari.</li>
        <li>Saut? for 1 minute before adding the shrimp tails.</li>
        <li>Cook for another minute and as soon as the liquid evaporates, add 1.3 oz of white wine, simmer and reduce.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat when the alcohol has fully evaporated and place the calamari and shrimps in a bowl; cover with the lid to keep them hot.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and toast for around 1 minute on the highest setting, stirring all the while to prevent any grains from burning.</li>
        <li>Once toasted, add the remaining part of the white wine (so 2 oz) and wait for the alcohol to evaporate before cooking the rice with the vegetable squash.</li>
        <li>You can add the squash gradually by the ladle, until fully cooked. Add the mussel and clam liquid and stir occasionally, but not too much.</li>
        <li>1-2 minutes before the end of the cooking time, add the shrimps and calamari, the mussels and clams 32 and leave to flavor.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, add the very cold and diced butter and stir to obtain a creamy consistency</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped parsley and the freshly ground pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir and leave to rest for a few minutes before placing on dishes.</li>
        <li>Your seafood risotto is ready: garnish the dishes with the mussels and clams to set aside for later.</li>
