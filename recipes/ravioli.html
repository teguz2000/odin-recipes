            Nothing surpasses the pleasure of making homemade egg pasta, and ravioli are among the most rewarding first courses to prepare, considering a classic: ricotta and spinach ravioli. 
            In this recipe, however, we aimed to give the ravioli a more refined and elegant shape, the perfect case for the delicious filling that brings together land and sea: they are ideal for a special dinner like Christmas Eve dinner or New Year's Eve! 
            The filling of these ravioli is a fresh and aromatic mix of shrimp, and for the sauce, we chose a reduction of shellfish broth with an intense flavor. The dish is completed with a stracciatella sauce and a turnip greens cream, creating a first course with captivating contrasts.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the shrimp, stracciatella, and turnip greens stuffed ravioli, start with the fresh pasta: pour the flour and eggs into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix first with a fork and then by hand, transferring to the work surface</li>
            <li>Work energetically for about 10 minutes, then form a dough ball, wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Clean the shrimp, keeping both the heads and shells (they will be used for the shellfish broth!), peel and chop the onion, carrot, and celery.</li>
            <li>Toast the vegetables in a saucepan with a drizzle of oil, add the shrimp shells and heads 8 and the tomato paste.</li>
            <li>Add aroma with a bunch of dill, deglaze with the cognac and flambé.</li>
            <li>Then cover with cold water and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Chop the shrimp with a knife, place them in a bowl with the ricotta, mix and season with salt and lime zest.</li>
            <li>Take the fresh pasta and flatten it with a rolling pin after dividing it into smaller pieces, work one piece at a time keeping the others covered with plastic wrap, so they don't dry out.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pasta with the pasta machine until you reach a thickness of about 1/8 inch, cut long rectangles and then squares of about 2 inches.</li>
            <li>Fill with the shrimp and ricotta filling using a pastry bag.</li>
            <li>Now close the pasta creating bundles: lift the opposite corners and make them adhere.</li>
            <li>Press the pasta well with your fingers to form the bundle.</li>
            <li>Transfer the ravioli to a tray lined with floured parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Strain the broth and reserve a ladle for the turnip greens.</li>
            <li>et the rest of the broth reduce on the stove until it forms a thick and concentrated sauce (this will take at least 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Cook the turnip greens in a pan with oil, garlic, and a pinch of salt until wilted.</li>
            <li>Add half of the turnip greens to the reserved shellfish broth and a drizzle of oil, blend with an immersion blender until you obtain a sauce.</li>
            <li>Also blend the stracciatella to obtain a smooth sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook the bundles in boiling salted water until they float to the surface.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, pour the fish broth reduction into a pan.</li>
            <li>Drain the ravioli into the pan with the broth reduction and let them soak for a moment.</li>
            <li>Plate the ravioli: distribute the stracciatella, turnip greens sauce on the plate, then place the ravioli on top and garnish with the whole turnip greens reserved.</li>
