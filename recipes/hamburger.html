        If you want to prepare a fantastic burger, follow our recipe for homemade hamburger patties and feel the difference! 
        We have used high-quality ground beef with which you can create 3 delicious meat patty variants: classic, herb, and cheese. 
        Then it's up to you to add the rest! Cheddar, lettuce, and pickles for the classic American cheeseburger, or toma cheese, potatoes, and green sauce for a tasty Piedmontese version... and at this point, why not make the typical burger buns with your own hands? 
        And if beef burgers aren't enough, you can always prepare chicken hamburgers! 
        Unleash your imagination and tell us about your dream sandwich, obviously with a homemade beef hamburger!</p>
